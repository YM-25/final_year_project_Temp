## Project description/introduction
A temperature independent period and temperature entrainment are two defining features of circadian oscilators. A default mechanism of distributed temperature compensation satisfies these basic facts yet is not easily reconciled with other properties of circadian clocks, such as many mutants with altered but temperature compensated periods. Here, the student will study simple models for limit cycles with analytically solvable periods and amplitudes. Subsequently, the student will contrast the default model with an alternative class of mechanisms where the twin properties of a fixed period and entrainment are structural and arise from an underlying adaptive system, similar to bacterial chemotaxis.
