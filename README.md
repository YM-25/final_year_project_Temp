## Project description/introduction
A temperature independent period and temperature entrainment are two defining features of circadianoscilators. A default mechanism of distributed temperature compensation satisfies these basic facts yet isnot easily reconciled with other properties of circadian clocks, such as many mutants with altered buttemperature compensated periods. Here, the student will study simple models for limit cycles withanalytically solvable periods and amplitudes. Subsequently, the student will contrast the default modelwith an alternative class of mechanisms where the twin properties of a fixed period and entrainment arestructural and arise from an underlying adaptive system, similar to bacterial chemotaxis. In addition toPython programming skills, the project will require significant math, knowledge about reaction dynamicsand their modelling, as well as creativity to model different mechanisms of temperature compensation andentrainment.
