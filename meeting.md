- separate the time series plot, add caption and note to them;
-   show tau as time, then use findpeak to calculate period
- rank on magnitude, keep only positive
- try to see symmetrical
- how well the model perform: approximation model vs real model
-   real model vs approximated model for oscillator

- schematics for the reaxtion, show model layout, like in the paper
