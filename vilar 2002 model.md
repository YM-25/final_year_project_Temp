for a biochemical model described as: 

Biochemical network of the circadian oscillator model. 

D~A~’ and D~A~ denote the number of activator genes with and without A bound to its promoter respectively; 

similarly, D~R~’ and D~R~ refer to the repressor promoter; 

M~A~ and M~R~ denote mRNA of A and R; A and R correspond to the activator and repressor proteins; 

and C corresponds to the inactivated complex formed by A and R. 

The constants 

α and α’ denote the basal and activated rates of
transcription, 

β the rates of translation, 

δthe rates of spontaneous egradation,  

γthe rates of binding of A to other components, 

and θdenotes the rates of unbinding of A from those components. 



Except if otherwise stated, in this paper we have assumed the following values for the reaction rates: 

α~A~ = 50 h^-1^, α~A’~= 500 h^-1^, 

α~R~ = 0.01 h^-1^, α~R’~ = 50 h^-1^, 

β~A~ = 50 h^-1^, β~R~ = 5 h^-1^, 

δ~MA~ = 10 h^-1^, δ~MR~ = 0.5 h^-1^, 

δ~A~ = 1 h^-1^, δ~R~ = 0.2 h^-1^, 

γ~A~ = 1 mol^-1^ hr^-1^, γ~R~ = 1 mol^-1^hr^-1^, γ~C~ = 2 mol^-1^ hr^-1^, 
θ~A~ = 50 h^-1^, θ~R~ = 100 h^-1^, where mol means number of molecules. 

The initial conditions are D~A~ = D~R~ = 1 mol, 

D~A~’ = D~R~’ = M~A~ = M~R~ = A = R = C = 0, 

which require that the cell has a single copy of the activator and repressor genes: D~A~ = D~A~’ = 1 mol and 

D~R~ = D~R~’ = 1 mol. 

The cellular volume is assumed to be the unity so that concentrations and number of molecules are equivalent. Notice that we assume that the complex breaks into R because of the degradation of A and, therefore, the parameter δA appears twice in the model.
