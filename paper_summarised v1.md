- ### [design principles of bichemical oscillators](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm2530)
  - Oscillators have systems-level characteristics (for example, periodicity, robustness and entrainment) that transcend the properties of individual molecules or reaction partners and that involve the full topology of the reaction network. These properties can only be fully understood by viewing experimental data from a theoretical perspective and by quantitative mathematical modelling of chemical oscillatory processes. These models address general concepts of dynamical systems, such as feedback, time delays, bistability and hysteresis.

1. *negative feedback* carry back to start point
2. *sufficient delayed in time* the rxn not stable steady state
   1. physical time constraint: *time for transcription, translation*; *time to transport species* e.g. protein production then transport out nucleus
   2. *reaction intermediates* e.g. metabolic pathway
   3. *dynamical hysteresis*
3. *sufficient non-linear* to destablise the steady state
4. *rxn on approximate time scale*
